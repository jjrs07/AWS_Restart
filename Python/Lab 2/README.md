# Lab 2: Working with Numeric Data Types

This lab introduces you to Pythonâ€™s built-in **numeric and boolean data types**.

---
## What You'll learn:
- The difference between `int`, `float`, and `complex` numbers
- What boolean values (`True` and `False`) represent
- How to check the data type of a variable using `type()`

## Sample Output

Python has three numeric types: int, float, and complex  
1  
3.14
5j  
True  
False  
1 is of the data type <class 'int'>  
3.14 is of the data type <class 'float'>  
5j is of the data type <class 'complex'>  
True is of the data type <class 'bool'>  
False is of the data type <class 'bool'>
