# Lab 8a: Working with Loops in Python

In this lab, you'll explore two types of loops in Python — `while` loops and `for` loops — using fun and practical examples.

## Lab 8: The Guessing Game (While Loop)

This activity introduces the `while` loop by letting the user play a simple **Guess the Number** game.

### What You’ll Learn
- How to use a `while` loop to repeat actions  
- How to generate random numbers with `random.randint()`  
- How to check user input using `if` conditions  
- How to use a **Boolean flag** to exit the loop when the condition is met

### Sample Output
Welcome to Guess the Number!  
The rules are simple. I will think of a number, and you will try to guess it.  
Guess a number between 1 and 10: 5  
You guessed 5. Sorry, that isn’t it. Try again.  
Guess a number between 1 and 10: 7  
You guessed 7. That is correct! You win!  


> 🔐 Pro tip: Uncomment the debug line `# print(number)` while testing to reveal the correct answer!

# Lab 8b: Count to 100 (For Loop)

This simple loop demonstrates how to use a `for` loop with a `range()` function to **count up to 99** (because Python’s `range()` stops before the upper limit).

### What You’ll Learn
- How `for` loops work  
- How to use `range(start, stop)` to control iteration  
- The difference between `for` and `while` loops

### 🧾 Sample Output
Count to 100!
