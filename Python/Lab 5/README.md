# Lab 5: Categorizing Values in a Mixed List

In this lab, you’ll learn how to loop through a list with **mixed data types** — and identify what each item is.

---

## What You'll Learn

- How to store **multiple data types** in a single list  
- How to iterate through each item using a `for` loop  
- How to dynamically print the value **and** its type  
- Why `"45"` (a string) is different from `45` (an integer)
- A deeper understanding of how Python treats numbers, strings, booleans, and more.

45 is of the data type <class 'int'>
